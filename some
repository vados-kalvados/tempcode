Business Analyst Hiring Process Guidelines
1. Candidate Time in Stream:
Maximum Duration: No candidate should remain in the hiring stream for more than 1 month from the date of initial entry into the stream.
2. CV Screening:
Responsible Party: Hiring Champions
Timeline: The CV screening step should be completed within 1 week of the candidate's profile being added to the portal.
Outcome: Hiring champions perform a simple check for experience and skill match, filling out the "review" form afterward.
3. Review by Hiring Manager:
Responsible Party: Hiring Manager
Timeline: After receiving the "review" form, the hiring manager should review the candidate's profile within 1 week.
Outcome: If the hiring manager is interested, they communicate with hiring champions and HR to schedule the first interview.
4. Scheduling of the First Interview:
Timeline: Once the hiring manager has accepted the candidate for the first round, the interview should be scheduled within 10 days.
5. Scheduling of the Second Interview:
Timeline: After completing the first round, the second interview should be scheduled within 7 days of the first interview's conclusion.
Interview Format: The second round should include the "values interview" and a discussion with senior managers if they express interest. If multiple teams are interested, representatives should present their roles during this round.
6. Offer Stage:
Timeline: After the second round, if a hiring manager is interested, the offer should be sent to the candidate within 1 week.
7. Automatic Rejection for Missed Deadlines:
If any of the outlined timelines are missed (CV screening, hiring manager review, interview scheduling, or offer delivery), the candidate will automatically be rejected from the process.
8. Weekly BA Hiring Call:
Participants: Recruiter, hiring champions, and hiring managers.
Objective: The status of each candidate in the stream should be discussed to ensure the timelines are being met. This call occurs weekly.
9. Multiple Teams Involved:
Collaboration: When multiple teams are hiring for the same candidate, the rules above should still apply. The representatives of interested teams will present their roles to the candidate at the second interview stage. This allows the candidate to select the most appropriate team.
Notes:
It is essential to ensure that each stage of the hiring process is streamlined and that candidates do not fall behind schedule. Regular coordination between hiring managers, champions, and HR is key to maintaining an efficient process.
