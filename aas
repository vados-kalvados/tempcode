Subject: Farewell and Thank You

Dear Team,

After a memorable journey with Company X, it's time for me to say goodbye. Reflecting on my time here, I’m filled with gratitude for the experiences I've gained, the projects I've worked on, and, most importantly, the opportunity to develop XX, which I hope continues to serve the team well.

Each challenge has been a learning experience, and each success a testament to the incredible people I’ve been privileged to work alongside. Thank you all for the collaboration, encouragement, and support over the years. I’ll carry forward the skills, insights, and friendships I’ve gained here.

Though I’m moving on to new adventures, I would love to stay connected. Please feel free to reach out anytime at [your email] or connect with me on LinkedIn at [your LinkedIn profile link].

Wishing everyone at Company X continued success and all the best for the future.

Warm regards,
[Your Full Name]
